defmodule AshMcp do
  @moduledoc """
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Elixir applications.

  AshMcp provides a framework for building MCP servers with support for:
  - Tools capability for exposing functions to AI agents
  - Resources capability for providing structured data access
  - Prompts capability for reusable prompt templates
  - Sampling capability for AI model configuration
  - OAuth authentication integration
  - Session management

  ## Basic Usage

  To create an MCP server, you define capability modules and configure a router:

      # Define a tools capability
      defmodule MyApp.McpTools do
        @behaviour AshMcp.Capability

        def capability_name, do: "tools"
        def capability_config, do: %{"listChanged" => false}

        def list_items(_session_id, _opts) do
          {:ok, [%{"name" => "my_tool", "description" => "Does something"}]}
        end

        def handle_method("tools/call", params, _session_id, _opts) do
          # Handle tool execution
          {:ok, %{"result" => "success"}}
        end
      end

      # In your Phoenix router
      scope "/mcp" do
        forward "/", AshMcp.Router,
          capabilities: [MyApp.McpTools],
          otp_app: :my_app
      end

  ## With Authentication

      scope "/mcp" do
        forward "/", AshMcp.Router,
          capabilities: [MyApp.McpTools],
          otp_app: :my_app,
          auth_enabled?: true,
          auth_strategies: [:github, :google]
      end
